## Our belief

Our goal is to advance the Philippine tech scene and increase access to opportunity for all.

Technology is the great equalizer of our generation. In today's knowledge economy, those who can learn, build, and sell online can not only earn a living but make a **good life** purely by using the products of their minds. Opportunities abound to change one's life no matter where you come from or what wealth or assets your family possesses.

It's all about where you want to go, who you want to be, and what you can actually **do**. 

In today's remote world, borders are meaningless. You can work from anywhere for any company in the world. The number of technology jobs and gigs only goes **up**. McKinsey estimates [20-50 million new technology-related jobs](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages) will be created by 2030. 

There are no limits. The only barrier to entry is a machine and an internet connection and we'll help you break through. We'll give you a surfboard to catch the craziest wave of our generation. All we ask for is a fervent desire to learn and to better your place in the world.

## FAQ

### How do you select beneficiaries?

We pick individuals based on their passion for coding or building (no-code builders are welcome!),determination, talent, and financial need.

We work with universities and organizations to collect a pipeline of candidates but will happily accept direct applications. 

Our vision is to give equal opportunity to anyone regardless of academic or organizational affiliation. We are in the process of creating an online application form for this. 

### Do beneficiaries need to pay for anything? Will they owe anything?

**No**. Everything we provide is for free, beneficiaries will not need to pay for anything or owe anything. 

If they find success, it would be great if they donate a machine and become a mentor to keep this positive cycle going, but this is not a requirement. 

Also, we would love it if beneficiaries build their own startups. They can always reach out to us for angel investments. :)

### How do you cover your costs?

Currently through donations but we are talking with partners to make us sustainable so we can provide a steady flow of laptops and other means to better support beneficiaries.

### What kind of support can beneficiaries expect?

* online mentorship + career advice from mentors in our Discord channel
* an eager audience to get feedback on things they build
* form friendships with other beneficiaries - hungry and passionate people working together are a force to be reckoned with!
* access to gig/job opportunities after they graduate through our mentors' networks
