## Our belief

Technology is the great equalizer of our generation. In today's knowledge economy, those who can learn, build, and sell online can not only earn a living but make a **good life** purely by using the products of their minds. Opportunities abound to change one's life no matter where you come from or what wealth or assets your family possesses.

It's all about where you want to go, who you want to be, and what you can actually **do**. 

In today's remote world, borders are meaningless. You can work from anywhere for any company in the world. The number of technology jobs and gigs only goes **up**. [McKinsey estimates](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages) 20-50 million new technology-related jobs will be created by 2030. 

There are no limits. The only entrance fee is a machine and an internet connection. 

We are angel investors in people. We are angel investors in **you**. We'll give you the surfboard you need to catch the craziest wave of our generation. All we ask for is a fervent desire to learn and to better your place in the world.

## FAQ

### \*Investing? So are you expecting monetary returns?

**NO**. 

Everything we provide is for free, beneficiaries will not need to pay anything back. While devseed.ph wont have any monetary returns, we get something way better: advancing the Philippine tech scene, building a community of like-minded individuals and increasing access to opportunities for all. 

Though we wouldn't mind if beneficiaries reach out to us in the future to fund their startups. :)
